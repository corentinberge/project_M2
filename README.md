# Command for the Yaskawa HC10 collaborative robot

This project was made by a group of student from the "UniversitÃ© Paul Sabatier" in Toulouse, France. 

The purpose of this project is to make a force feedback control for the collaborative robot Yaskawa HC10.

You will find identification and control code + the ros code to make it run on the simulator rViz of ROS.
